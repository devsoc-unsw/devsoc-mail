# Workshop 6 - Databases

Authors: Alfie Chen, Kim Lam, Eve Miles

## Introduction

Make sure to follow along in the demo so you can complete connecting the backend to the MongoDB database, authRegister and viewAllMail !!

Your tasks are to:

- Complete the `getEmail` function
- Complete the `sendMail` function
- Complete the `readMail` function

all of which is located under backend/src/services/mail.services.ts

> ❗️ Hint: have a look at how auth.services.ts uses MongoDB functions, or keep the documentation handy to find out what each MongoDB function does !! This can be found at https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/js-collection/
