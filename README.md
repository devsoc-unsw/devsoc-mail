# devsoc.mail

This is the main repository in which 2025 UNSW Software Development Society's (DevSoc) Training Program bases its exercises and demonstrations in. Our program runs 6 core workshops per term, 5 of which correspond to some branches in this repository. There are also additional workshops, which will be included in branches labelled ws7 and beyond. The full working version of the project, as completed in the core workshops, is in the main branch.

Additional information on the workshop can be found in the book: https://devsoc-unsw.github.io/training-program-exercises/book/

Made for uni students, by uni students.

## Running the code
Please note that currently, the backend will not work because we do not supply a .env file that contains a MongoDB connection string. You will need to setup a MongoDB database and connect it yourself.

Run the frontend with the commands: ``cd frontend``, ``npm i``, ``npm run dev``.

Run the backend with the commands: ``cd backend``, ``npm i``, ``npm start``.
