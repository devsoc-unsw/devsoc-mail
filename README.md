## Task 2: Create a Register Page

Right now, devsoc-mail only has a login page. It's your job to create their register page as devsoc's frontend developer.

1. Head to `frontend/src/pages/` directory
2. Open `RegisterPage.tsx` file
3. Work on a register page based on the figma you and your team created last workshop.

## Task 3: Modifying Props

The login page displays the button with text 'MODIFY ME.' Change the props of `AuthButton` such that the text changes based on input.

1. Head to `frontend/src/components/` directory
2. Open `AuthButton` folder
3. Work on `AuthButton.tsx` and finish the task

## Task 4: Routing

The view page, used for displaying emails, is currently inaccessible!
Open `App.tsx` and follow the instructions within to change that.

Then, add a `<Link />` to the register page from the login page.
