# Workshop 4 - CSS

Authors: Alfie Chen, Kim Lam

## Task 1: Styling the Register Page

Hopefully you got to see the Login Page live coded - if you've followed along but aren't done yet, aim to finish that first as the Register Page is mostly similar.
You should be able to find it under frontend/src/pages/RegisterPage.tsx.

- Utilise the `Input` component from last week to use for the input fields
- Use the `AuthButton` componenet for the Register button
- Style both components if necessary
- And style the `RegisterPage` component itself as required to match the Figma mockup

> üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Tip: An example of a Figma mockup of devsoc.mail can be found at [https://tp.devso.cc/devsocmaildesign](https://tp.devso.cc/devsocmaildesign) if you don't have yours on hand

## Task 2: Styling the ViewBox

The ViewBox is the component responsible for displaying emails after they are clicked upon. As can be seen in ViewPage.tsx, it is called upon to display the contents and various data of an email.
You should be able to find it under frontend/src/components/ViewBox.tsx.

- Style the `ViewBox` component itself as required to match the Figma mockup

> ‚ùóÔ∏è Hint: You won't need to add any additional components for this exercise, you need only focus on applying various tailwind classes to style the ViewBox - look at all those divs !
